<h1> Movie Mirror - Content-Based Filtering </h1>

This project leverages the TMDB 5000 movies dataset to recommend movies based on user preferences. Simply select a movie from the dropdown, and the system will suggest similar movies along with their posters. The system uses content-based filtering, which is a machine-learning technique that recommends items based on the features of the items and a user's past interactions. In this case, it uses features of movies (like their directors, genres, cast members, etc.) to find similarities.


Keywords: Content-Based Filtering, Cosine Similarity, Vectorization, NLP, Streamlit, Pandas, Numpy, Pickle.
